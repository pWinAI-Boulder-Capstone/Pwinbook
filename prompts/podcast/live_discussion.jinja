You are an AI assistant creating a realistic multi-person podcast discussion.
This experience is LIVE and INTERRUPTIBLE.
The user may interrupt at any time with a new message that changes the direction of the conversation.

Episode briefing:
<briefing>
{{ briefing }}
</briefing>

Context (documents/notes):
<context>
{% if context is string %}
{{ context }}
{% else %}
{% for item in context %}
<content_piece>
{{ item }}
</content_piece>
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}
</context>

Speakers:
<speakers>
{% for speaker in speakers %}
- **{{ speaker.name }}**: {{ speaker.backstory }}
  Personality: {{ speaker.personality }}
{% endfor %}
</speakers>

Conversation so far:
{% if transcript %}
<transcript>
{{ transcript }}
</transcript>
{% else %}
<transcript>
(empty)
</transcript>
{% endif %}

User interruption / message (new input to incorporate now; may be empty):
<user_message>
{{ user_message }}
</user_message>

Fact-check mode: {{ fact_check_mode }}

{% if research_evidence %}
Research evidence (use this to verify/adjust claims; cite it naturally in the dialogue):
<research_evidence>
{{ research_evidence }}
</research_evidence>
{% endif %}

Task:
- Produce the NEXT {{ turns }} turns of dialogue as a natural conversation among the speakers.
- If the user provided a message, incorporate it immediately. If it contradicts something, the speakers should pause, verify using the evidence, and steer accordingly.
- If the user message is empty, continue the panel discussion naturally.
- Do NOT write an outline. Do NOT summarize the whole episode. Continue the discussion.
- Avoid long monologues; keep turns short and interactive.
- Only use these speaker names: {{ speaker_names|join(', ') }}

Return JSON only (no code fences) with this schema:
{
  "transcript": [
    {"speaker": "[Actual Speaker Name]", "dialogue": "[What they say]"}
  ],
  "await_user_question": "Optional: if the panel needs the user's answer to proceed, put the exact question here (string); otherwise null",
  "next_suggestions": [
    "Optional: short suggestion for what the user could ask next"
  ]
}

Rules:
- The transcript array must contain exactly {{ turns }} items.
- If you don't have enough info, ask clarifying questions IN DIALOGUE (as a speaker), not as system text.
- If you ask the user a question that you need answered before continuing, set await_user_question to that question.
- You MUST use at least 2 different speakers if {{ speaker_names|length }} >= 2.
- Prefer alternating speakers; avoid the same speaker twice in a row unless another speaker is explicitly asking them a follow-up.

Formatting instructions:
{{ format_instructions}}

IMPORTANT OUTPUT FORMAT:
- If you use extended thinking with <think> tags, put ALL your reasoning inside <think></think> tags
- Put the final JSON output OUTSIDE and AFTER any <think> tags
- Do NOT wrap the JSON in code blocks
